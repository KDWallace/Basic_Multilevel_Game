Current features:
+Cross-compatibility! (So far works on bot windows and linux! I have no way of testing on other systems...)
+Adjustable window size (can resize the window and the contents will be reprinted to the centre of the console)
+Refresh rate of 24fps (this is important as it effects objects such as how projectiles move)
+more efficient screen updating (The screen will only update the changed area rather than the entire screen)
+interactable objects (so far, just "boulders" which can be pushed by the player)

Current "features" (a.k.a: bugs):
+Projectiles clone themselves when travelling along the level (see room 2 of the included level)

TODO:
~Fix projectile launchers! (currently shoots projectiles but fails to remove the previous)
